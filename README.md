# hazard

A Clojure library for getting random dictionary words; use the included
wordlist, or provide your own!

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/fardog/hazard/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/fardog/hazard)

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[hazard.core :refer :all])

; use the default wordlist
(words 2) ; ("orals" "yelping")
(words 2 {:min 8}) ; ("favorite" "hucksters")
(words 3 {:max 5}) ; ("shins" "miner" "item")
(words 2 {:min 8 :max 8}) ; ("kayakers" "jokester")

; provide a path to one
(words "my/list.txt" 3) ; ("my" "great" "words")

; or just provide a list
(words ["bear" "cat" "dog"] 2 {:max 3}) ; ("dog" "cat")
```

## API

- **words**
    - `(words num-words)`
    - `(words coll num-words)`
    - `(words file-path num-words)`

Each arity can take an `opts` map as its last parameter, with the following
keys:

- `:min` the least of characters you'd like a returned word to contain
- `:max` the most characters you'd like a returned word to contain

If you ask for more items than can be provided from a given word set, an
exception is thrown:

```
user=> (require '[hazard.core :as hazard])
nil
user=> (hazard/words ["bear" "cat" "dog"] 3 {:max 3})

Exception More items requested than are available.  hazard.common/do-take-random-n (common.clj:7)
user=> 
```

## Implementation Notes

- The word list is read synchronously at the first call to `words`, same if you
  provide a file as a string. Any subsequent calls will use the file that's
  already been read into memory. If you need control over how the file is read,
  you can read it yourself and then pass a collection of words as the first
  parameter.
- A word list file is expected to be a list of words separated by newlines
- The default word list's resource file path is exported as a
  `clojure.java.io/file` at `hazard.core/default-words`.

## Test

```bash
$ lein test
